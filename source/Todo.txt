- space bar should capture
- adjust list size to the icons V
- check if we can capture in different resolution than viewfinder (no)
- play a video
- inset in the middle
- delete from the middle
- maybe capture with opencv


qv4l2 -V /dev/video1 (from v4l-utils) does a very good job!

other apps: guvcview or webcamoid for settings
